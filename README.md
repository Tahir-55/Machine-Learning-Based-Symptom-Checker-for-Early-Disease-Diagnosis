# Machine-Learning-Based-Symptom-Checker-for-Early-Disease-Diagnosis
summary
This study presents a symptom-based machine learning method to illness prediction. Through the use of federated learning simulation, the RandomForest Classifier in the system is trained on decentralized data to simulate three nodes. The models are then combined to create a global model.

Based on symptoms entered by the user, the final model can forecast illnesses.

Features
Decentralized Learning Simulation: Models are trained locally on each of the three subsets that make up the training dataset. To create a global model, the trained models are combined.
Robust, ensemble-based learning technique for illness prediction: RandomForest Classifier.
User Symptom Input: This feature lets users enter their symptoms to determine a condition.
Model Aggregation creates a more comprehensive global model by combining the parameters of several models.
